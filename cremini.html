    <p>
      Also called Crimini mushrooms and they actually exist in the same species classification as Button Mushrooms. 

      Cremini mushrooms are a deeper brown and deeper flavor. 

      Actually, all Button mushrooms used to be brown until a farmer in 1926 found an odd bunch of mushrooms that appeared white. He cloned them and made bank.
