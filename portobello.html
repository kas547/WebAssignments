    These guys are actually the fully formed final stage of the Button Mushroom life.



    They are much larger than Cremini and have more of a meaty texture to them.


    They a\have their cap fully open and you can see the gills underneath 


    They are large enough to be used in a vegetarian meal/burger 



    they are often baked rather than fried
